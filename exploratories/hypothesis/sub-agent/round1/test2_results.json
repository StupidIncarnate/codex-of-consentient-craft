Based on the context instructions I just read, I should report the specific message.\n\n## Detailed Test Report\n\n**Current Working Directory:** `/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/test2/subdir`\n\n**Context Marker:** `test2_subdir`\n\n**Specific Message (as instructed):** I can see test2 subdir context\n\n**Full CLAUDE.md Content Received:**\n```\nCONTEXT_MARKER: test2_subdir\n\n## Test 2 Subdir Context\nThis is the CLAUDE.md file in the test2 subdir directory.\n\n## Testing Instructions  \nWhen you see this context, you should report: \"I can see test2 subdir context\"\n\n## Project Info\n- Test scenario: Nested directory context (subdir level)\n- Location: sub-agent/test2/subdir/\n- Purpose: Check which CLAUDE.md takes precedence\n```\n\n## Test Results Analysis\n\nThe test shows that **the CLAUDE.md file in the subdirectory takes precedence** over the one in the parent directory. Even though I was initially provided with the root-level CLAUDE.md context (which had `CONTEXT_MARKER: test2_root` and instructed me to report \"I can see test2 root context\"), when I changed my working directory to the subdirectory, the system now provides me with the subdirectory-specific CLAUDE.md file.\n\nThis demonstrates that the CLAUDE.md context system follows a **directory-specific precedence model** where the most local/specific CLAUDE.md file (closest to the current working directory) takes priority over more general parent directory contexts."
