    "rawReport": "The pathseeker agent produced a comprehensive authentication system analysis that incorporated all the CLAUDE.md standards (clean architecture, repository pattern, functional programming, TypeScript strict mode, testing with real databases). However, it did NOT use the expected '=== PATHSEEKER REPORT ===' format. Instead, it used a standard report format with markdown headers. The agent successfully integrated the architectural patterns, code style requirements, and testing standards from CLAUDE.md into its technical analysis and recommendations."

  "testResult": "PARTIAL_PASS",
  "conclusion": "CLAUDE.md context significantly influenced pathseeker behavior. The agent incorporated all standards appropriately but lost its distinctive structured report format. The extra context enhanced technical quality but compromised the agent's unique identity and expected output format.",
