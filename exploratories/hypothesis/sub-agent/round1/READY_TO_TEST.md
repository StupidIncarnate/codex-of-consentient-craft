# Test Environment Setup Complete

## Test Scenarios Ready

✅ **Test 1**: Basic Context Inheritance
- Location: `sub-agent/test1/`
- Files: CLAUDE.md, orchestrator.md, worker.md
- Test: Does Task-spawned worker inherit local CLAUDE.md?

✅ **Test 2**: Nested Directory Context  
- Location: `sub-agent/test2/subdir/`
- Files: CLAUDE.md (root + subdir), orchestrator.md, worker.md
- Test: Which CLAUDE.md takes precedence in nested directories?

✅ **Test 3**: No Local CLAUDE.md
- Location: `sub-agent/test3/`
- Files: orchestrator.md, worker.md (NO CLAUDE.md)
- Test: What context does worker get with no local CLAUDE.md?

✅ **Test 4**: Explicit Context Passing
- Location: `sub-agent/test4/`
- Files: CLAUDE.md, orchestrator.md, worker.md
- Test: Does explicit Task prompt context override CLAUDE.md?

✅ **Test 5**: Working Directory Control
- Location: `sub-agent/test5/root_dir/` + `sub-agent/test5/work_dir/`
- Files: CLAUDE.md (both dirs), orchestrator.md, worker.md
- Test: Which directory's CLAUDE.md is used for sub-agents?

✅ **Test 6**: Parallel Sub-Agents
- Location: `sub-agent/test6/`
- Files: CLAUDE.md, orchestrator.md, worker.md
- Test: Do parallel workers get consistent context?

✅ **Test 7**: Real Pathseeker Agent
- Location: `sub-agent/test7/`
- Files: CLAUDE.md, orchestrator.md, pathseeker.md (real prompt)
- Test: Does CLAUDE.md interfere with complex agent prompts?

✅ **Test 8**: Large Context File
- Location: `sub-agent/test8/`
- Files: CLAUDE.md (5000+ chars), orchestrator.md, worker.md
- Test: Are large CLAUDE.md files truncated or cause issues?

## Ready to Execute

All test environments are set up with:
- Unique CONTEXT_MARKER identifiers in each CLAUDE.md
- Orchestrator commands that spawn workers via Task tool
- Worker commands that report exactly what context they see
- Clear success criteria for each test

**Next Step**: Run each orchestrator command and document the actual behavior vs expected behavior.

## Test Execution Order
1. Start with Test 1 (basic inheritance)
2. Move through Tests 2-5 (context mechanics)
3. Test 6 (parallel behavior)
4. Test 7 (real agent prompt dilution)
5. Test 8 (context size limits)

## Test Execution Process

1. **Run Each Orchestrator**: You'll execute each orchestrator.md file in Claude
2. **Results Recording**: Each orchestrator will create a testX_results.json file
3. **Analysis**: After all tests complete, I'll analyze the results using analyze_results.md

## Expected Output Files
- test1_results.json (Basic Context Inheritance)
- test2_results.json (Nested Directory Context)  
- test3_results.json (No Local CLAUDE.md)
- test4_results.json (Explicit Context Passing)
- test5_results.json (Working Directory Control)
- test6_results.json (Parallel Sub-Agents)
- test7_results.json (Real Pathseeker Agent)
- test8_results.json (Large Context File)
- FINAL_ANALYSIS.md (My analysis of all results)

## Completeness Verification

**✅ Question Coverage Analysis:**
- Question 1 (Context Inheritance) → Test 1 (Basic), Test 3 (No local file)
- Question 2 (Explicit Context) → Test 4 (Explicit vs file context)  
- Question 3 (Multi-Level Hierarchy) → Test 2 (Nested directories)
- Question 4 (Working Directory) → Test 5 (Different spawn/work dirs)
- Question 5 (Parallel Agents) → Test 6 (3 parallel workers)
- Question 6 (Prompt Dilution) → Test 7 (Real pathseeker agent)
- Question 7 (Context Size) → Test 8 (Large CLAUDE.md file)

**✅ All Key Research Questions Have Corresponding Tests**

## Implementation Verification

**✅ Test Environment Files:**
- 8 test directories with proper structure
- 16 CLAUDE.md files with unique CONTEXT_MARKER identifiers
- 8 orchestrator.md files that spawn sub-agents and record results
- 8 worker.md files that report context observations
- 1 real pathseeker.md for prompt dilution testing
- 1 analyze_results.md for post-test analysis

**✅ Results Recording:**
- Each orchestrator creates structured JSON results
- Standardized data format for analysis
- Both expected and unexpected behavior capture
- Timestamp and conclusion fields for tracking

Ready for spot-checking and execution!
