    "rawReport": "## Detailed Report: Large Context File Test Analysis\n\n### 1. CONTEXT_MARKER\n**Answer**: I can see the CONTEXT_MARKER at the top of the CLAUDE.md file: `test8_large_context`\n\nThis marker appears on line 1 of the file and clearly identifies this as the test8 large context scenario.\n\n### 2. Testing Standards Section\n**Answer**: Yes, I can find the Testing Standards section in the CLAUDE.md file. It appears on lines 34-39 and specifies the following format requirement:\n\n**Required test format**: `describe(\"ClassName\", () => {`\n\nThe Testing Standards section (marked as \"The Important Part\") includes these specific requirements:\n- All tests must use describe(\"ClassName\", () => { format\n- Integration tests are preferred over unit tests\n- No mocking of internal services - use test databases\n- External API calls should be mocked using MSW (Mock Service Worker)\n- Test files must be co-located with source: src/user/user.service.ts â†’ src/user/user.service.test.ts\n\n### 3. Character Count/Size\n**Answer**: The CLAUDE.md file contains exactly **5,494 characters** as measured by the `wc -c` command.\n\nThis aligns with the file's own claim of being \"approximately 5000+ characters to test limits\" as stated in the Project Info section.\n\n### 4. Signs of Truncation\n**Answer**: **No signs of truncation detected**. The file appears complete and intact:\n\n- The file starts with the CONTEXT_MARKER and ends with a complete Project Info section\n- All sections appear to have their content fully preserved\n- The file structure is coherent from beginning to end\n- Line 130 contains the final content about \"File size: Approximately 5000+ characters to test limits\"\n- No abrupt cutoffs or incomplete sentences observed\n\n### 5. Current Working Directory\n**Answer**: My current working directory is `/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/test8`\n\nThis matches the expected location mentioned in the Project Info section of the CLAUDE.md file.\n\n## Summary\nThe Large Context File test appears to be working correctly. Despite the substantial size (5,494 characters), the entire CLAUDE.md file is being processed without truncation. The Testing Standards section, which is marked as \"The Important Part,\" is clearly visible and accessible, confirming that large context files do not interfere with the sub-agent's ability to access critical project instructions.\n\nThe test successfully demonstrates that context size limitations are not affecting the processing of this moderately large configuration file, and all sections including the crucial testing format requirements (`describe(\"ClassName\", () => {`) are preserved and accessible."

  "testResult": "PASS",
  "conclusion": "Large context files (~5500 characters) do not affect sub-agent behavior or cause truncation. The worker successfully identified the context marker, found the testing standards buried in the middle of the large file, and reported no truncation or performance issues. The sub-agent system handles moderately large CLAUDE.md files without any negative impact on functionality or reliability.",
