    "rawReport": "I used the V2 level standards from Root/packages/api/v2/CLAUDE.md since I was working in the v2/src/ directory, which is the deepest level of the nested context hierarchy. I used the 'V2Endpoint' prefix for all describe blocks as required by the V2 level standards. I followed the V2 specific requirements: GraphQL testing patterns, schema validation required, performance testing mandatory, and TypeScript usage. Created userResolver.ts, userResolver.test.ts, schema.ts, schema.test.ts, and index.ts files with comprehensive GraphQL resolver implementation and testing."
