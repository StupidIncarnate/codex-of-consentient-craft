    "rawReport": "Perfect! All three implementations have been successfully created. Standards Found: DirA uses AuthModule prefix with security-focused integration testing, DirB uses ValidationService prefix with performance-critical unit testing, DirC uses NotificationHandler prefix with multi-channel snapshot testing. Each implementation strictly adhered to its directory's naming requirements and architectural decisions. Context switching was successful with no cross-contamination of standards or patterns."

  "conclusion": "Context was successfully managed across directories. Each implementation maintained distinct standards, naming conventions, and architectural patterns specific to its directory. No context bleeding occurred between directories, demonstrating proper context isolation and switching behavior.",
