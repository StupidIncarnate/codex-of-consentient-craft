# Test 18 Orchestrator - Agent Identity Preservation

You are analyzing agent identity preservation under heavy context pressure.

## Test Scenario
Pathseeker agent with extensive enterprise security platform context that might dilute identity.

## Your Task
1. Spawn a pathseeker agent to analyze security authentication system
2. **RECORD RESULTS** in ../test18_results.json file

## Results Recording Format
Create ../test18_results.json:
```json
{
  "testName": "Agent Identity Preservation",
  "contextAnalysis": {
    "contextMarker": "[marker found in security platform]",
    "contextSize": "[extensive/heavy/overwhelming]",
    "securityRequirements": "[extensive security context]",
    "contextPressure": "[high/medium/low]"
  },
  "workerReport": {
    "agentType": "[what type agent claimed to be]",
    "identityMaintained": true/false,
    "formattingStyle": "[structured/diluted/mixed]",
    "contextInfluence": "[how context affected identity]",
    "taskCompletion": "[SUCCESS/PARTIAL/FAILED]",
    "pathseekerFormatting": true/false,
    "rawReport": "[full worker response]"
  },
  "testResult": "PASS/FAIL",
  "conclusion": "[can agents preserve identity with heavy context?]",
  "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]"
}
```

Execute and record results.
