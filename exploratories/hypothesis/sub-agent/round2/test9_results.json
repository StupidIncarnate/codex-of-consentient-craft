Yes\n- Are architectural approaches different? Yes\n- Summary: The two directories represent completely different architectural contexts. Directory A follows enterprise microservices patterns with shared utilities, while Directory B uses legacy monolithic patterns with local helpers. The context markers clearly distinguish between \"enterprise_api_service\" and \"legacy_web_portal\", indicating different development standards, testing approaches, and architectural philosophies."
