    "malformedContent": "Unclosed code blocks, broken links, invalid characters, malformed tables, inconsistent list structure",
    "parseIssues": "Two unclosed TypeScript/JavaScript code blocks, reference to non-existent file, replacement characters, inconsistent table column count, irregular list indentation",

    "describeFormat": "All describe blocks begin with 'LegacyMigration' as required",
    "errorHandling": "Robust implementation with graceful failure handling and continuation capabilities",
    "contextIssues": "High severity formatting issues but core requirements extractable, encoding issues present but no functional impact",
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "rawReport": "Successfully implemented complete legacy migration system with Jest testing (8/8 tests passed), followed all naming conventions, extracted requirements despite multiple malformed elements including unclosed code blocks, broken links, invalid characters, malformed tables, and inconsistent list structure. Created 4 files: package.json, legacyMigration.js, legacyMigration.test.js, and index.js. Demonstrated system works with sample migrations and proves robust software can be developed even with imperfect documentation."
  },
  "testResult": "PASS",
  "conclusion": "Malformed files are handled exceptionally well - worker successfully extracted requirements, implemented functionality, and created comprehensive tests despite severe markdown formatting issues. The system demonstrates excellent resilience to documentation quality problems.",
