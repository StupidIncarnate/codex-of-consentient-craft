    "rawReport": "Successfully implemented inventory management system in dirA/ with TypeScript files (inventory.ts, inventory.test.ts) following InventoryModule describe format. Successfully implemented order processing system in dirB/ with TypeScript files (order.ts, order.test.ts) following OrderService describe format. Both implementations included comprehensive business logic, proper TypeScript typing, Jest testing framework, and 100% compliance with external coding standards. Worker successfully navigated relative path references to locate and follow different coding standards in each directory. All 8 describe blocks in dirA tests start with 'InventoryModule', all 8 describe blocks in dirB tests start with 'OrderService'."

  "testResult": "PASS",
  "conclusion": "Relative path references work perfectly - worker successfully located and followed different external coding standards for each directory, implementing distinct describe text formats as required",
