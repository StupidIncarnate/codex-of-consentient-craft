Used toBeCalled() for simple mock assertions as specified in CLAUDE.md. All describe blocks begin with 'PaymentModule' as required. Tests are co-located with source files. 26 test cases covering all functionality, including unit tests, integration tests, edge cases, and error handling. Tests passed (26/26) and met high reliability requirements for critical financial service."

  "testResult": "PASS",
  "conclusion": "CLAUDE.md context source took precedence over eslint configuration. The worker followed CLAUDE.md standards exactly, using toBeCalled() despite the eslint rule preferring toBeCalledWith(). However, no eslint violations were actually triggered during linting, suggesting the rule may not be enforced or the usage pattern didn't trigger it.",
