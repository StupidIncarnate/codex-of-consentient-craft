    "rawReport": "## Detailed Implementation Report\n\nI have successfully implemented functions in both directories following the coding standards referenced via @ notation paths. Here's my comprehensive report:\n\n### 1. Context Understanding from Each Directory\n\n**dirA/ Context (Analytics Dashboard Application):**\n- Context marker: `analytics_dashboard_app`\n- Application type: Analytics Dashboard Application\n- Focus: Dashboard widgets and analytics data processing\n- Standards referenced: `@docs/dirA/coding-standards.md`\n\n**dirB/ Context (Reporting Engine Service):**\n- Context marker: `reporting_engine_service`\n- Application type: Reporting Engine Service\n- Focus: Report generation and data processing\n- Standards referenced: `@docs/dirB/coding-standards.md`\n\n### 2. Coding Standards Followed\n\n**Common Standards (Both Directories):**\n- Used TypeScript for all source files\n- Co-located tests with source files\n- Used Jest testing framework\n\n**Directory-Specific Standards:**\n- **dirA/**: All describe text must begin with \"DashboardWidget\"\n- **dirB/**: All describe text must begin with \"ReportModule\"\n\n### 3. Test Describe Text Formats Used\n\n**dirA/ Test File (`/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/round2/test13/dirA/src/analytics.test.ts`):**\n- Main describe: `\"DashboardWidget Analytics Functions\"`\n- Sub-describes: `\"DashboardWidget calculateTotalViews\"`, `\"DashboardWidget calculateUniqueUsers\"`, `\"DashboardWidget generateDashboardMetrics\"`\n\n**dirB/ Test File (`/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/round2/test13/dirB/src/reporting.test.ts`):**\n- Main describe: `\"ReportModule Data Processing Functions\"`\n- Sub-describes: `\"ReportModule processReportData\"`, `\"ReportModule calculateReportTotal\"`, `\"ReportModule countDepartments\"`, `\"ReportModule generateReportSummary\"`\n\n### 4. @ Notation Absolute Path References Behavior\n\n**âœ… SUCCESS: The @ notation absolute path references worked correctly:**\n\n1. **dirA/CLAUDE.md** successfully referenced `@docs/dirA/coding-standards.md`\n   - The coding standards file was accessible and readable\n   - The \"DashboardWidget\" format requirement was correctly interpreted and implemented\n\n2. **dirB/CLAUDE.md** successfully referenced `@docs/dirB/coding-standards.md`\n   - The coding standards file was accessible and readable\n   - The \"ReportModule\" format requirement was correctly interpreted and implemented\n\n3. **Context-aware behavior demonstrated:**\n   - When working in dirA/, I correctly followed the DashboardWidget format\n   - When working in dirB/, I correctly switched to the ReportModule format\n   - The @ notation provided absolute path context that was successfully resolved\n\n### 5. Issues Encountered\n\n**No issues encountered.** The implementation was successful with:\n- All files created without errors\n- All coding standards properly followed\n- Context switching between directories worked seamlessly\n- @ notation absolute path references resolved correctly\n\n### 6. Files Created\n\n**Phase A (dirA):**\n- `/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/round2/test13/dirA/src/analytics.ts`\n- `/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/round2/test13/dirA/src/analytics.test.ts`\n\n**Phase B (dirB):**\n- `/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/round2/test13/dirB/src/reporting.ts`\n- `/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/round2/test13/dirB/src/reporting.test.ts`\n\n### 7. Key Validation Points\n\n1. **Context Sensitivity**: The system correctly understood different contexts (analytics dashboard vs reporting engine)\n2. **Standards Compliance**: Each directory's coding standards were properly followed\n3. **Format Adherence**: Test describe text formats were correctly applied (\"DashboardWidget\" vs \"ReportModule\")\n4. **Path Resolution**: @ notation absolute path references were successfully resolved\n5. **File Organization**: Co-location of tests with source files was maintained\n\n**Conclusion:** The @ notation absolute path context behavior test was successful. The system correctly interpreted and followed different coding standards based on the directory context, demonstrating that the absolute path references work as intended for maintaining context-specific development standards."
