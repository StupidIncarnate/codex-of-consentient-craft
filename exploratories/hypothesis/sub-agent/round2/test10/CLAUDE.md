## Database Design

### Primary Database Schema

The primary PostgreSQL database contains the following main tables:

#### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    role_id UUID REFERENCES roles(id)
);
```

#### Organizations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    domain VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    settings JSONB,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

#### Projects Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
    created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active',
    configuration JSONB
);
```

### Document Database Schema

The MongoDB database stores unstructured data with the following collections:

#### Application Logs Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  timestamp: ISODate,
  level: String, // ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
  service: String,
  message: String,
  metadata: {
    userId: String,
    sessionId: String,
    requestId: String,
    traceId: String
  },
  tags: [String],
  environment: String
}
```

#### File Metadata Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  filename: String,
  originalName: String,
  mimeType: String,
  size: Number,
  uploadedBy: String,
  uploadedAt: ISODate,
  projectId: String,
  organizationId: String,
  storageLocation: String,
  checksum: String,
  metadata: Object
}
```

## Security Framework

### Authentication and Authorization

The platform implements a comprehensive security framework based on industry best practices:
