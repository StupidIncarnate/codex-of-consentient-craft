# Speckit POC

## Initial
- It has a similar init command like claude to dictate "these are the most important things in this repo"
- [constitution.md](.specify/memory/constitution.md)


## Pros
- Has configurable templates for plan/spec/tasks and agent files which is nice

## Modes

### specify
Switched to a new branch and used sub agent to explore against requirements.
Didnt ask me for clarifications, just said here's the plan, tweak if you want. 
[spec.md](specs/001-e2e-testing/spec.md)
[requirements.md](specs/001-e2e-testing/checklists/requirements.md)
Wrote em as user stories and BDD reqs which is nice.
Even without asking me follow-ups, pretty good spec plan. 
Keeps it very high-level
