# CLI Pivot Implementation Validation Report

## Overview

This document validates the implementation of the CLI pivot requirements as specified in `plan/pivot-phase.md` against the actual codebase.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED Requirements

### 1. Core Module Structure
- ✅ **src/core/** - All specified modules exist:
  - `quest-manager.ts` - Quest lifecycle management with all required methods
  - `config-manager.ts` - Configuration handling with discovery tracking
  - `file-system.ts` - File operations with quest folder management
  
- ✅ **src/models/** - All data models implemented:
  - `quest.ts` - Quest, Phase, Task interfaces as specified
  - `config.ts` - Configuration interfaces
  - `agent.ts` - Agent report interfaces with proper types

- ✅ **src/agents/** - Agent orchestration implemented:
  - `agent-spawner.ts` - Spawns Claude CLI with markdown prompts
  - `report-parser.ts` - Parses JSON reports from agents
  
- ✅ **src/utils/** - Utility functions:
  - `logger.ts` - Colored console output
  - `validators.ts` - Validation logic
  - `type-guards.ts` - Type safety utilities

### 2. CLI Commands
All commands from pivot-phase.md are implemented in `src/cli.ts`:
- ✅ `questmaestro` - Resume active quest or create new
- ✅ `questmaestro list` - Show all quests by status
- ✅ `questmaestro abandon` - Abandon current quest
- ✅ `questmaestro start <quest>` - Jump to specific quest
- ✅ `questmaestro clean` - Remove old completed/abandoned quests
- ✅ `questmaestro <description>` - Create new quest

### 3. Agent Updates
All agents have been updated to write JSON reports:
- ✅ Pathseeker - Writes to `questmaestro/active/[quest]/[num]-pathseeker-report.json`
- ✅ Codeweaver - Writes to `questmaestro/active/[quest]/[num]-codeweaver-report.json`
- ✅ Siegemaster - Writes to `questmaestro/active/[quest]/[num]-siegemaster-report.json`
- ✅ Lawbringer - Writes to `questmaestro/active/[quest]/[num]-lawbringer-report.json`
- ✅ Spiritmender - Writes to `questmaestro/active/[quest]/[num]-spiritmender-report.json`
- ✅ Voidpoker - Writes to `questmaestro/discovery/voidpoker-[timestamp]-[package]-report.json`

### 4. File-Based Communication
- ✅ Agents write JSON reports using Write tool
- ✅ CLI monitors for report files (500ms intervals)
- ✅ Report numbering follows sequential pattern (001, 002, 003...)
- ✅ Quest folders organized as specified

### 5. Quest Management
- ✅ Quest state tracking in quest.json
- ✅ Phase progression (discovery → implementation → testing → review)
- ✅ Task dependency validation
- ✅ Execution log tracking
- ✅ Moving quests between states (active/completed/abandoned)

### 6. Agent Spawning
- ✅ Claude CLI spawning with markdown prompts
- ✅ Context formatting for each agent type
- ✅ Report file monitoring
- ✅ Basic recovery mechanism for failed agents

### 7. Project Discovery
- ✅ Auto-launch Voidpoker if discoveryComplete=false
- ✅ Package.json detection
- ✅ Sequential Voidpoker spawning for each package
- ✅ Discovery reports saved to questmaestro/discovery/

### 8. Ward Validation
- ✅ Run ward:all after each Codeweaver
- ✅ Spawn Spiritmender on ward failures
- ✅ Basic error handling (single attempt)

## ❌ MISSING/INCOMPLETE Requirements

### 1. Advanced Recovery Mechanisms
**Specified in pivot-phase.md but not fully implemented:**
- ❌ **Pathseeker recovery assessment for partial Codeweaver work**
  - When Codeweaver crashes mid-task, spawn Pathseeker in 'recovery_assessment' mode
  - Pathseeker analyzes the current codebase state vs the original task
  - Returns a report with: files_completed, files_partial, files_missing
  - Determines if task should continue from where it left off or restart
- ❌ **Multiple recovery attempts tracking**
  - Store recovery attempt count in quest state (max 3 attempts per agent)
  - Each recovery includes previous failure reason in context
  - After 3 failures, mark task as blocked for manual intervention
- ❌ **Recovery context preservation**
  - Pass crash report, partial work assessment, and previous contexts to recovering agent
  - Include recoveryMode: true and previousReportNumbers array in AgentContext

### 2. Blocked Agent Continuation
**Missing functionality:**
- ❌ **Interactive user input for blocked agents**
  - When agent reports status: 'blocked', prompt user with blockReason
  - Use readline.createInterface() to get user input synchronously
  - User provides guidance on how to proceed (e.g., "Use PostgreSQL for the database")
- ❌ **Continuation context with previous report number**
  - Re-spawn same agent with continuationMode: true in AgentContext
  - Include previousReportNumber (e.g., "002" if continuing from 002-pathseeker-report.json)
  - New report gets next number (e.g., "003-pathseeker-report.json")
- ❌ **User guidance integration**
  - Add userGuidance field to AgentContext when continuing
  - Agent markdown prompt includes [CONTINUATION MODE] section
  - Shows previous report number and user's guidance text

### 3. Spiritmender Retry Logic
**Incomplete implementation:**
- ❌ **MAX_SPIRITMENDER_ATTEMPTS (3) not enforced**
  - Define constant MAX_SPIRITMENDER_ATTEMPTS = 3 in quest-manager.ts
  - Track attempt count in quest state: spiritmenderAttempts: { [taskId: string]: number }
  - Before spawning Spiritmender, check if attempts[taskId] >= MAX_SPIRITMENDER_ATTEMPTS
  - If max attempts reached, mark task as blocked and require manual intervention
- ❌ **Previous attempts tracking**
  - Pass attemptNumber to Spiritmender context: { attemptNumber: attempts[taskId] || 1 }
  - Include previous error messages in context for learning: previousErrors: string[]
  - Spiritmender can see what didn't work before and try different approaches
- ❌ **Ward errors saved to ward-errors-unresolved.txt**
  - After each failed ward run, append errors to questmaestro/active/[quest]/ward-errors-unresolved.txt
  - Format: `[timestamp] [attempt-number] [task-id] [error-details]`
  - When task finally passes, remove its entries from the file
  - File serves as persistent error log for debugging patterns
- ❌ **Incremental attempt handling**
  - Attempt 1: Basic fixes (imports, syntax, type errors)
  - Attempt 2: Deeper analysis (logic errors, test expectations)
  - Attempt 3: Last resort (refactor approach, question assumptions)
  - Each attempt gets more context about what failed previously

### 4. Task Reconciliation
**Missing Pathseeker resume features:**
- ❌ **EXTEND/CONTINUE/REPLAN validation modes**
  - When Pathseeker is spawned with mode: 'validation', it analyzes existing task list
  - Returns reconciliation plan with one of three modes:
    - EXTEND: Add new tasks to existing list (when current tasks are good but incomplete)
    - CONTINUE: Keep existing tasks as-is (when current plan is still valid)
    - REPLAN: Replace task list entirely (when approach needs fundamental change)
  - Quest manager applies the reconciliation based on returned mode
- ❌ **New task insertion with runBefore**
  - Pathseeker can insert tasks at specific positions using runBefore property
  - Example: { id: 'new-task', runBefore: 'existing-task-id', ... }
  - Quest manager reorders task execution to honor runBefore constraints
  - Validates that runBefore references exist in current task list
- ❌ **Dependency modification for existing tasks**
  - Pathseeker returns taskUpdates array: { taskId: string, newDependencies: string[] }
  - Allows adding dependencies to existing tasks without full replacement
  - Example: Task A now depends on new Task B that was inserted
  - Quest manager merges dependency updates into existing task definitions
- ❌ **Obsolete task marking**
  - Pathseeker can mark tasks as obsolete: { taskId: string, obsolete: true, reason: string }
  - Obsolete tasks are skipped during execution but kept in history
  - Useful when codebase changes make planned tasks unnecessary
  - Quest state tracks: obsoleteTasks: { [taskId: string]: { reason: string, markedAt: Date } }

### 5. Quest Completion
**Incomplete features:**
- ❌ **Retrospective collection from all reports**
  - When quest completes, scan all report files in quest folder
  - Extract retrospective field from each report (if present)
  - Collect in order: pathseeker → codeweaver → siegemaster → lawbringer reports
  - Each agent provides insights from their perspective
- ❌ **Combined retrospective markdown generation**
  - Create structured markdown combining all retrospectives:
    ```markdown
    # Quest Retrospective: [Quest Title]
    
    ## Quest Summary
    - Started: [date]
    - Completed: [date]
    - Total tasks: [count]
    - Agents involved: [list]
    
    ## Agent Insights
    
    ### Pathseeker
    [Pathseeker's retrospective about planning and task design]
    
    ### Codeweaver
    [Codeweaver's notes about implementation challenges]
    
    ### Siegemaster
    [Test coverage insights and edge cases discovered]
    
    ## Key Learnings
    - What went well
    - What could improve
    - Patterns to remember
    ```
- ❌ **Retrospective file creation in questmaestro/retros/**
  - Save as questmaestro/retros/[quest-folder]-retrospective.md
  - Include quest ID and completion timestamp in filename
  - Index file questmaestro/retros/index.json tracks all retrospectives
  - Retrospectives serve as learning material for future quests

### 6. Helper Functions
**Missing implementations:**
- ❌ **validateQuestFreshness for old quests**
  - Function signature: validateQuestFreshness(quest: Quest): { isStale: boolean, reason?: string }
  - Checks if quest is too old to resume (default: 30 days)
  - Analyzes if codebase has significantly changed since quest started
  - Compares quest creation date with recent git commits
  - Returns reason like: "Quest older than 30 days", "Major refactoring detected"
  - Stale quests prompt user to abandon and create fresh quest
- ❌ **getCreatedFiles/getChangedFiles extraction from reports**
  - Parse agent reports to extract file change information:
    ```typescript
    function getCreatedFiles(reports: AgentReport[]): string[] {
      return reports
        .filter(r => r.agentType === 'codeweaver')
        .flatMap(r => r.report.filesCreated || []);
    }
    
    function getChangedFiles(reports: AgentReport[]): string[] {
      return reports
        .filter(r => r.agentType === 'codeweaver')
        .flatMap(r => r.report.filesModified || []);
    }
    ```
  - Used by Siegemaster to know which files need tests
  - Used by quest summary to show impact
  - Helps track quest progress and scope
- ❌ **Detailed execution plan generation**
  - Before executing tasks, generate human-readable plan:
    ```
    Execution Plan for Quest: Add Authentication
    
    1. Create auth service (no dependencies)
       - Will create: src/auth/auth.service.ts
       - Estimated time: 5 minutes
    
    2. Create auth controller (depends on: task-1)
       - Will create: src/auth/auth.controller.ts
       - Will modify: src/app.module.ts
       - Estimated time: 3 minutes
    
    3. Add auth tests (depends on: task-1, task-2)
       - Will create: src/auth/auth.service.test.ts
       - Will create: src/auth/auth.controller.test.ts
       - Estimated time: 10 minutes
    ```
  - Shows task order, dependencies, and expected changes
  - Helps user understand what will happen before execution

### 7. Command Router Pattern
**Not implemented as specified:**
- ❌ **Separate command-router.ts module**
  - Extract command routing logic from cli.ts into dedicated module
  - Define CommandRouter class with register() and execute() methods
  - Centralize all command definitions in one place
  - Makes adding new commands easier and more maintainable
- ❌ **Command classes/registry pattern**
  - Each command as a class implementing ICommand interface:
    ```typescript
    interface ICommand {
      name: string;
      description: string;
      aliases?: string[];
      execute(args: string[]): Promise<void>;
    }
    
    class ListCommand implements ICommand {
      name = 'list';
      description = 'List all quests by status';
      
      async execute(args: string[]) {
        const quests = await questManager.listQuests();
        // ... display logic
      }
    }
    ```
  - CommandRegistry maintains map of command name → command instance
  - Supports command aliases (e.g., 'ls' → 'list')
  - Better testability - each command can be unit tested independently
- ❌ **The current implementation uses simple function mapping**
  - Current: Direct function calls in if/else chain
  - Proposed: router.execute(commandName, args)
  - Benefits: Cleaner code, easier to extend, better error handling
  - Can add features like command validation, middleware, help generation

### 8. Interactive Features
**Limited implementation:**
- ❌ **Better progress visualization during agent execution**
  - Current: Simple "Waiting for report..." message
  - Proposed: Dynamic progress indicator with spinner and status:
    ```
    [⠋] Spawning Pathseeker... (5s)
    [⠙] Pathseeker analyzing codebase... (12s)
    [⠹] Pathseeker generating tasks... (18s)
    [✓] Pathseeker complete - 5 tasks created (22s)
    ```
  - Show elapsed time for each agent
  - Update status based on partial report writes
  - Use colors: yellow=running, green=success, red=failed
- ❌ **Real-time agent status updates**
  - Monitor agent markdown files for status markers
  - Agents write progress markers: `<!-- STATUS: Analyzing dependencies -->`
  - CLI reads these markers and updates display
  - Provides feedback during long-running operations
  - Example statuses: "Reading files", "Planning approach", "Writing code"
- ❌ **Interactive mode improvements**
  - Add questmaestro --interactive flag for guided experience
  - Prompts user for choices instead of requiring full commands
  - Example flow:
    ```
    Welcome to QuestMaestro Interactive Mode!
    
    What would you like to do?
    1. Resume current quest (Add authentication)
    2. Start a new quest
    3. List all quests
    4. Clean up old quests
    
    Choice: 1
    
    Resuming quest: Add authentication
    Next task: Create auth service
    
    Ready to proceed? (y/n): y
    ```
  - Reduces cognitive load for new users
  - Still supports direct command mode for power users

## 🔧 Implementation Gaps Summary

### Critical Missing Features:
1. **Recovery System** - The sophisticated recovery mechanism with Pathseeker assessment is not implemented
2. **Blocked Agent Handling** - No interactive continuation for blocked agents
3. **Spiritmender Retries** - Single attempt only, no retry loop
4. **Task Reconciliation** - Pathseeker can't modify existing task dependencies
5. **Retrospectives** - No retrospective generation on quest completion

### Non-Critical Missing Features:
1. **Command Router** - Works fine with current simple approach
2. **Progress Visualization** - Basic logging works but could be enhanced
3. **Parallel Execution** - Sequential-only as intended for MVP

## Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes:
1. Implement Spiritmender retry loop with attempt tracking
2. Add blocked agent continuation with user input
3. Implement task reconciliation for Pathseeker resume mode
4. Add retrospective generation on quest completion

### Medium Priority:
1. Implement recovery assessment with Pathseeker
2. Add validateQuestFreshness for old quest handling
3. Extract created/changed files from agent reports

### Low Priority (Post-MVP):
1. Enhanced progress visualization
2. Command router pattern refactoring
3. Parallel agent execution support

## Conclusion

The core CLI pivot functionality is implemented and working:
- ✅ Agents write JSON reports
- ✅ CLI orchestrates agents sequentially
- ✅ File-based communication works
- ✅ Quest management tracks state
- ✅ Commands function as specified

However, several advanced features from the specification are missing, particularly around error recovery, blocked agent handling, and task reconciliation. These gaps should be addressed to fully meet the pivot-phase.md requirements.
