# Implementation Roadmap - Phased Rollout

## Overview

Implementing the Quest Maestro npm distribution system requires careful phased rollout to:

- Validate architecture at each stage
- Build team familiarity progressively
- Minimize risk and allow course correction

## Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-2)

### Goal

Create working `@questmaestro/standards` package with core documentation and init script.

### Tasks

**Documentation Split**

- [ ] Extract from current `project-standards.md`:
    - `docs/core-rules.md` (300 lines) - Universal rules
    - `docs/folders/contracts-guide.md` (400 lines)
    - `docs/folders/brokers-guide.md` (450 lines)
    - `docs/folders/transformers-guide.md` (350 lines)
    - `docs/folders/guards-guide.md` (300 lines)
    - `docs/folders/adapters-guide.md` (400 lines)
    - `docs/decisions/which-folder.md` (400 lines)
    - `docs/decisions/extend-vs-create.md` (350 lines)
    - `docs/anti-patterns/training-data-traps.md` (400 lines)

**Package Structure**

- [ ] Create `@questmaestro/standards` directory structure
- [ ] Set up package.json with bin scripts
- [ ] Implement `bin/init-claude-docs.js`
- [ ] Create `templates/CLAUDE.md.template`
- [ ] Create `templates/first-10-files/` starter scaffold

**Testing**

- [ ] Test init script on macOS
- [ ] Test init script on Linux
- [ ] Test init script on Windows (symlink + junction fallback)
- [ ] Verify symlink auto-sync works

**Publishing**

- [ ] Publish `@questmaestro/standards@0.1.0-beta.1` to npm
- [ ] Test installation in clean project
- [ ] Verify documentation loads correctly

**Success Criteria**

- ✅ Init script creates `.claude/` structure
- ✅ Symlinks work on all platforms (or fallback to copy)
- ✅ Root CLAUDE.md generated correctly
- ✅ Can load `.claude/_framework/standards/core-rules.md`

## Phase 2: Testing Package (Weeks 3-4)

### Goal

Add `@questmaestro/testing` package with cross-references to standards.

### Tasks

**Package Creation**

- [ ] Create `@questmaestro/testing` package structure
- [ ] Extract testing docs from current repo
- [ ] Add cross-references to `@questmaestro/standards` docs
- [ ] Create test examples and templates

**Integration**

- [ ] Update `@questmaestro/standards` init script to link testing docs
- [ ] Test combined doc loading (standards + testing)
- [ ] Verify cross-reference links work

**Publishing**

- [ ] Publish `@questmaestro/testing@0.1.0-beta.1`
- [ ] Test peer dependency resolution
- [ ] Install both packages in clean project

**Success Criteria**

- ✅ Testing docs appear in `.claude/_framework/testing/`
- ✅ Cross-references between packages work
- ✅ Context loading stays under 1200 lines per task

## Phase 3: ESLint Integration (Weeks 5-6)

### Goal

Enhance `@questmaestro/eslint-plugin` with pedagogical errors and doc links.

### Tasks

**Pedagogical Errors**

- [ ] Update error messages to reference `.claude/_framework/` paths
- [ ] Add "why this rule exists" to each error
- [ ] Include example fixes in error output

**Rule Documentation**

- [ ] Create `docs/rule-explanations.md`
- [ ] Document each rule with:
    - What it enforces
    - Why it exists (anti-training-data)
    - How to fix violations
    - Link to relevant guide

**Integration**

- [ ] Update init script to link eslint-plugin docs
- [ ] Add version alignment check
- [ ] Test lint errors provide useful guidance

**Publishing**

- [ ] Publish `@questmaestro/eslint-plugin@0.1.0-beta.1`
- [ ] Update all packages to peer-depend on each other

**Success Criteria**

- ✅ Lint errors reference framework docs
- ✅ Error messages are pedagogical, not just technical
- ✅ Version mismatch warnings appear correctly

## Phase 4: Hooks Package (Weeks 7-8)

### Goal

Create `@questmaestro/hooks` for pre-commit and context loading automation.

### Tasks

**Pre-Commit Hooks**

- [ ] Create pre-commit validation script
- [ ] Check folder structure compliance
- [ ] Run ESLint with framework rules
- [ ] Validate doc freshness (CLAUDE.md < 6 months old)

**Context Loading (if Claude Code supports)**

- [ ] Intelligent context loading based on file being edited
- [ ] Auto-suggest which guide to read
- [ ] Pre-load relevant anti-patterns

**Integration**

- [ ] Hook into git pre-commit
- [ ] Test with Husky/lint-staged
- [ ] Verify hooks don't slow down commits too much

**Publishing**

- [ ] Publish `@questmaestro/hooks@0.1.0-beta.1`
- [ ] Document setup instructions

**Success Criteria**

- ✅ Pre-commit hooks catch violations
- ✅ Hooks complete in < 5 seconds
- ✅ Context suggestions are accurate

## Phase 5: Beta Testing (Weeks 9-10)
