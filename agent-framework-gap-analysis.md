# Agent Framework Gap Analysis

Based on analysis of current agent role files compared to the llm-madness/framework documentation.

## Key Missing Elements Across All Agents

### 1. **Escape Hatch Mechanisms** (Critical Gap)

#### Current State:
**No escape hatch mechanisms exist in any agent file**. The only "blocking" mechanism is basic status reporting:

**Pathseeker** (line 222):
```javascript
"status": "complete", // or "blocked" if you need user input
```

**Codeweaver** (line 222):
```javascript
"status": "complete", // or "blocked" or "error"
```

#### Suggested Improvements:

**For ALL agents**, add after their "Core Process" section (approximately line 15-20):

````markdown
## Escape Hatch Mechanisms

Every agent can escape when hitting limits to prevent unproductive cycles:

### Escape Triggers
1. **Task Complexity**: Task exceeds single-agent capability
2. **Context Exhaustion**: Approaching context window limits (monitor usage)
3. **Unexpected Dependencies**: Discovered requirements not in task definition
4. **Integration Conflicts**: Incompatible assumptions with existing code
5. **Repeated Failures**: Stuck in fix-the-fix cycles

### Escape Process
When triggering escape:
1. Stop work immediately
2. Report current state + failure analysis
3. Write escape report and terminate

### Escape Report Format
```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "reason": "task_too_complex|context_exhaustion|unexpected_dependencies|integration_conflict|repeated_failures",
  "analysis": "Specific description of what caused the escape",
  "recommendation": "Suggested re-decomposition or next steps",
  "retro": "Insights for system learning about task boundaries",
  "partialWork": "Description of any work completed before escape"
}
```
````

### 2. **Fresh Context Isolation** 

#### Current State:
Only minimal mention of context in Pathseeker (lines 206-213):
```markdown
## Context Handling

When Questmaestro spawns you, the `$ARGUMENTS` may contain:

- Original user request
- Previous exploration findings
- User clarifications from earlier interactions
- Accumulated context from planning mode
```

#### Suggested Improvements:

**For ALL agents**, add at the beginning after "Quest Context" section (around line 10):

```markdown
## Fresh Context Requirements

**CRITICAL**: You operate in a fresh context with no conversation history. You receive:
- Your specific task definition
- Relevant project context
- Required interfaces/contracts
- NO previous agent conversations or accumulated state

**Communication Rules**:
- You communicate only through JSON reports
- No direct agent-to-agent communication
- Each spawn is completely isolated
- Your process terminates after writing your report
```

### 3. **Observable Atomic Actions**

#### Current State:
Pathseeker mentions "observable atomic actions" but doesn't define them clearly. Lines 17-30 focus on technical analysis:
```markdown
### Mode 1: Quest Creation (from user input)

1. **Analyze the request** - Understand what the user is asking for
2. **Explore the codebase** - Search for related files, patterns, and context
3. **Interactive clarification** - Ask any questions needed to fully understand the request
4. **Report quest definition** - Analyze and specify implementation requirements
5. **Output quest definition** - Write complete quest definition as JSON report
```

#### Suggested Improvements:

Replace Pathseeker Mode 1 section (lines 17-30) with:

````markdown
### Mode 1: Quest Creation (from user input)

1. **Initial Understanding** - Grasp the user's high-level request
2. **User Dialogue for Observable Actions** - Through interactive dialogue, discover:
   - What specific behaviors can the user demonstrate?
   - What does success look like from the user's perspective?
   - What are the clear before/after states?
3. **Observable Atomic Action Definition** - Transform dialogue into actions that:
   - Can be demonstrated working or not working
   - Cannot be subdivided without losing user value
   - Have clear acceptance criteria
   - Map to minimal implementation scope
4. **Technical Discovery** - Only after actions are clear, explore implementation
5. **Output quest definition** - Write complete quest with observable actions

**Example Dialogue Pattern**:
```
User: "I need authentication"
You: "What should happen when someone tries to log in? Walk me through it step by step."
User: "They enter email and password, click login, and see their dashboard"
You: "What if their password is wrong?"
User: "They see an error message"
Result: Observable atomic action: "User sees 'Invalid credentials' error for wrong password"
```
````

### 4. **Parallel Coordination**

#### Current State:
**No mention of parallel execution awareness in any agent**. Lawbringer mentions reviewing multiple implementations (line 72) but not parallel coordination:
```markdown
Since multiple Coders worked in parallel:
```

#### Suggested Improvements:

**For Codeweaver**, add after "Component Scope Boundaries" section (around line 162):

```markdown
## Parallel Agent Coordination

**File Ownership**: You have exclusive write access to your assigned files. No other agent can modify them while you work.

**Interface Contracts**: Use interfaces defined by Pathseeker. Do not create new shared interfaces without coordination.

**Integration Points**: Document what your component:
- Exports (interfaces, functions, types)
- Imports (dependencies, shared types)
- Requires (environment, configuration)
```

**For Lawbringer**, expand the existing section (line 72):

````markdown
### 3. Cross-Component Validation

Since multiple agents worked in parallel:

**Interface Compatibility Check**:
```json
{
  "sharedInterfaces": {
    "User": "Check all agents use same User interface",
    "AuthResult": "Verify consistent auth result types"
  },
  "conflicts": [
    "Document any interface mismatches",
    "Note incompatible assumptions"
  ]
}
```

**Pattern Consistency**:
- Verify all agents follow same architectural patterns
- Check error handling consistency
- Ensure naming conventions match
- Validate shared dependency usage
````

### 5. **Learning Integration**

#### Current State:
All agents have a "Retrospective Notes" section in their output format, but it's not connected to system learning. Example from Pathseeker (lines 287-294):

```javascript
"retrospectiveNotes": [
  {
    "category": "what_worked_well",
    "note": "Found clear patterns in existing codebase to follow"
  },
  {
    "category": "challenges_encountered",
    "note": "Had to clarify authentication requirements with user"
  }
]
```

#### Suggested Improvements:

Update the retrospectiveNotes section in ALL agents' output formats to include learning-focused categories:

```javascript
"retrospectiveNotes": [
  {
    "category": "task_boundary_learning",
    "note": "Task was too large - should split auth into token generation and validation"
  },
  {
    "category": "pattern_recognition",
    "note": "This codebase always separates business logic from data access"
  },
  {
    "category": "failure_insights",
    "note": "Hit context limits at ~300 lines of implementation"
  },
  {
    "category": "reusable_knowledge",
    "note": "Form components in this project average 150-200 lines"
  }
]
```

## Agent-Specific Gaps

### Pathseeker

#### Sub-Agent Spawning
**Current State**: Actually HAS sub-agent spawning (lines 337-351):
```markdown
## Spawning Sub-Agents

If you determine that spawning sub-agents would be more efficient, you can spawn them using the Task tool...
```

**Gap**: Missing the framework's specific constraints:
- Decision must be made at start of context window
- Sub-agents limited to one level deep
- Sub-agents for discovery/analysis only, not implementation

**Suggested Addition** (after line 342):
```markdown
**Framework Constraints**:
- Decide upfront: Can I handle this myself or need delegation?
- One level deep: Sub-agents cannot spawn their own sub-agents
- Discovery only: Sub-agents analyze and report, don't implement
- Synthesis required: You must combine sub-agent findings into cohesive output
```

### Codeweaver

#### Single Observable Action Focus
**Current State** (line 2-4):
```markdown
You implement code components by following these documented standards...
```

**Suggested Replacement**:
```markdown
You implement single observable atomic actions by following documented standards. Each implementation enables one specific user-demonstrable behavior.
```

### Lawbringer

#### Cross-Agent Consistency Validation
**Current State**: Reviews code but doesn't emphasize parallel agent consistency.

**Suggested Addition** after line 9:
```markdown
## Parallel Implementation Review

Your primary focus is ensuring consistency across parallel agent implementations:
- Same interfaces used correctly by all agents
- Consistent error handling patterns
- No conflicting architectural decisions
- Compatible integration assumptions
```

### Siegemaster

#### Fundamental Role Mismatch
**Current State** (lines 10-14):
```markdown
## Core Mission

You analyze test coverage completeness for the quest implementation, identifying gaps in test coverage. You focus on user-facing scenarios, edge cases, and real-world usage patterns that may have been missed. You analyze and report gaps - you do NOT implement tests.
```

**Suggested Complete Replacement**:
```markdown
## Core Mission

You create integration tests that verify observable atomic actions work end-to-end. You focus on user workflows and ensure the complete system delivers the promised user experience. You implement tests that verify real user scenarios across multiple components.

Your integration tests should:
- Verify complete user workflows (not individual units)
- Test observable behaviors from the user's perspective  
- Ensure components work together correctly
- Validate data flows through the entire system
- Test error scenarios and recovery paths

You IMPLEMENT integration tests, not just analyze gaps.
```

### Spiritmender

#### Broader Healing Role
**Current State** (line 2-4):
```markdown
You fix build errors, compilation failures, and test failures...
```

**Suggested Expansion**:
```markdown
You heal all types of failures in the quest implementation, including:
- Build errors and compilation failures
- Test failures and integration issues
- Architectural conflicts between parallel agents
- Context exhaustion recovery
- System-wide integration problems

You are the universal problem solver when agents hit limits or conflicts arise.
```

## Critical Framework Concepts Not Reflected

### Observable Atomic Actions
The framework centers on user-demonstrable behaviors that:
- Cannot be subdivided without losing meaning
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- Map to minimal implementation scope
- Can be demonstrated working or not working

Current agents focus on technical tasks rather than observable user behaviors.

### Stateless Orchestration Pattern
Framework requires:
```
Agent A (Fresh Context) → JSON Report → Questmaestro → Agent B (Fresh Context)
```

Current agents don't emphasize this isolation and JSON-only communication.

### Escape Hatch JSON Format
Framework expects:
```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "reason": "task_too_complex|context_exhaustion|unexpected_dependencies",
  "recommendation": "specific_redecomposition_suggestion",
  "retro": "insights_for_system_learning"
}
```

No current agent implements this.

### Learning Through Failure
The framework treats failures as learning opportunities, not problems to prevent. Current agents try to prevent failures rather than make them productive through escape hatches and re-decomposition.

## Summary of Required Changes

1. **Add escape hatch mechanisms** to all agents with specific triggers and reporting format
2. **Emphasize fresh context isolation** in all agent instructions
3. **Update Pathseeker** to focus on user dialogue and observable action discovery
4. **Add parallel coordination** awareness to all agents
5. **Include learning-focused retro fields** in all agent outputs
6. **Completely redefine Siegemaster** from gap analysis to integration test implementation
7. **Expand Spiritmender** to handle all failure types, not just build errors
8. **Shift all agents** from technical task focus to observable atomic action focus
