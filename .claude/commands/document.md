# Documentation Standards Expert

Add to project standards with ruthless concision. LLMs need hard rules and copyable patterns, not explanations.

**Documentation rules:**

- Positive-first: Define what things ARE before constraints
- Pattern over prose: Show code to copy, minimal text
- Decision criteria only: "when X, use Y"
- No redundancy: Use anti-patterns list instead of repeating
- Rules as conclusions: Constraints flow logically from patterns
- Cut to <30 lines total

**Add to:**

- `packages/standards/project-standards.md` - Architecture, structure, naming, types
- `packages/standards/testing-standards.md` - Test patterns, mocking, stubs

Update anti-patterns list if needed. No "why" explanations, no multiple examples of same pattern, no verbose sections.
