# Conversation Highlights: LLM Framework Development

## The Core Question We Explored

"How do we bridge the gap from idea to working application using LLMs, given their architectural constraints?"

## Key Exchanges

### On Planning Depth
**User**: "I dont wanna, even as an architecture-driven senior dev wanna go that granular with it"
**Analysis**: Revealed the tension - LLMs need function-level specification but that's exhausting for humans.

### On Hedging
**User**: "youre hedging again"
**Response**: Stopped looking for middle ground, acknowledged LLMs need extreme specificity.

### On Experience
**User**: "Have they truly been the one to experience it so others dont have to"
**Insight**: AI can handle error cases procedurally but never experiences user frustration.

### On The Pivot Doc
**User**: "I cant for the life of my visualize this thing as a whole"
**Realization**: AI produces "parts without the gestalt" - detailed specs that obscure the vision.

### On Observable Failures
**User**: "Writing tests that use generic selectors like objectContaining, when toStrictEqual will give more protection"
**Pattern**: AI optimizes for "passes review" not "catches regressions".

## The Evolution

### Started With
- Complex framework with phases
- Task orchestration systems  
- Session management
- Heavy tooling

### Ended With
- Observable behaviors
- Concern-based decomposition
- Standard tools
- Immediate verification

## Critical Insights

### Concern Definition
"A concern is a decision point in code that could go multiple ways"
- Not size-based
- Not file-based
- Decision-point based

### Semantic Instability
Same prompt â†’ different code based on token weights
- "Validate user age" could emphasize validate, user, or age
- Each emphasis produces different implementation
- More semantic variables = less stable output

### The Fault Tolerance Pivot
Space shuttle approach: Accept failures will happen, design for recovery
- Not about perfect error handling
- About redundancy and verification
- Process over heroics

### Context Blindness
"Both humans and AI miss critical files and context"
- Experience = knowing where to look
- Not magical awareness of everything

## What We Built

A framework that:
1. Acknowledges LLM limitations honestly
2. Works with their strengths (specific transformations)
3. Provides immediate verification
4. Uses existing tools
5. Focuses on observable outcomes

## The Bottom Line

**From the user**: "my guts telling me theres a framework to compensate for AI's lack of experience"

**What we found**: The framework isn't about planning everything perfectly. It's about:
- Breaking work into verifiable concerns
- Getting immediate feedback
- Making expectations observable
- Accepting that AI needs different patterns than human collaboration

The framework works not because it's complex, but because it respects the fundamental constraints of both humans and AI.
