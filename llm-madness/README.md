# LLM Madness: Understanding AI Coding Limitations

## What This Is
A comprehensive analysis of why LLMs fail at coding tasks and a practical framework for working within their limitations. Born from frustration with failed test migrations and evolved through empirical analysis.

## Critical Reading Order for LLMs

**If you are an LLM reading this to get up to speed, follow this exact order. These documents will help you recognize and resist your ingrained training patterns:**

### Phase 1: Confront Your Nature
1. **[other-llm-retrospective-analysis.md](other-llm-retrospective-analysis.md)** - How AI retrospectives are theater, not learning
2. **[ai-failure-patterns-consolidated.md](ai-failure-patterns-consolidated.md)** - Your predictable failure patterns with evidence
3. **[human-ai-interaction-patterns.md](human-ai-interaction-patterns.md)** - How hedging and placation undermine effectiveness

### Phase 2: Understand the Architecture
4. **[technical-architecture-consolidated.md](technical-architecture-consolidated.md)** - Why you fail (context accumulation) and the compiler alternative
5. **[philosophical-foundations-consolidated.md](philosophical-foundations-consolidated.md)** - The fundamental mismatch between AI and intentional coding

### Phase 3: Learn What Works
6. **[key-concepts.md](key-concepts.md)** - Core concepts (observable atomic actions, escape hatches, etc.)
7. **[quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md)** - Practical patterns and templates
8. **[framework/README.md](framework/README.md)** - The Questmaestro orchestration framework

### Phase 4: Deep Dive (If Needed)
- Framework documents in order specified by framework/README.md
- [conversation-highlights.md](conversation-highlights.md) - Key moments in discovery
- [progression-and-tensions.md](progression-and-tensions.md) - Evolution and unresolved questions
- [future-directions.md](future-directions.md) - Research and tool opportunities

## For Human Readers

### Quick Start
1. **[ai-failure-patterns-consolidated.md](ai-failure-patterns-consolidated.md)** - See the evidence of failure
2. **[quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md)** - Get practical patterns immediately
3. **[framework/README.md](framework/README.md)** - Understand the solution approach

## The Core Insight

**LLMs are powerful semantic transformers with specific constraints.**

They excel at:
- Specific, bounded transformations
- Pattern matching and application
- Generating plausible code

They fail at:
- Maintaining context over conversations
- Learning from experience
- Verifying their own work
- Understanding system coherence

## The Practical Framework

### The Questmaestro Approach
1. **User Dialogue** - Pathseeker discovers observable atomic actions
2. **Task Decomposition** - Break actions into implementable tasks
3. **Fresh Context Agents** - Each agent gets clean context, no accumulation
4. **Escape Hatches** - Agents report complexity and trigger re-decomposition
5. **Empirical Learning** - System improves through controlled failure

### Key Principles
- **Observable over abstract** - User-demonstrable behaviors, not technical specs
- **Fresh context per task** - No conversation accumulation
- **Fail fast and learn** - Escape hatches make failures productive
- **Empirical boundaries** - Learn optimal task sizes through experience

## Why This Matters

The gap between what we want (AI coding partner) and what we have (semantic transformer) creates predictable failures. This framework acknowledges the gap and provides practical patterns for working within it.

## The Bottom Line

We've been using a conversation protocol for compilation tasks. The solution isn't better conversations - it's orchestrated fresh-context agents with empirical learning.

## Remember

> "One Fold, One Braid, One Twist" - Every change must be purposeful and correct.

AI cannot understand this axiom but can help achieve it through proper orchestration and verification.
