# Orchestration Patterns: Common Quest Coordination Strategies

Proven patterns for coordinating agents across different types of development quests, with escape hatch integration and learning mechanisms.

## Theoretical Foundation

**Pattern Recognition in Agent Coordination**: Different types of development work require different orchestration approaches. Rather than using one-size-fits-all coordination, the system recognizes quest patterns and applies appropriate agent coordination strategies.

**Key Insight**: The orchestration pattern emerges from the **observable atomic actions** identified during Pathseeker dialogue, not from technical categorization.

## Quest Pattern Classification

### Pattern 1: User Journey Enhancement

**Characteristics**: Adding or improving specific user workflows
**Observable Actions**: Clear user before/after states
**Coordination Pattern**: Sequential with user feedback loops

**Example**: "Improve checkout process"
```json
{
  "pattern": "user_journey_enhancement",
  "observableActions": [
    "User can add items to cart without page refresh",
    "User sees running total update immediately", 
    "User can remove items with single click",
    "User sees shipping options before payment"
  ],
  "orchestration": "sequential_with_feedback"
}
```

**Agent Coordination**:
```
Pathseeker: Define complete user journey
↓
Codeweaver-1: Implement cart state management  
↓
User Validation: Test cart behavior
↓
Codeweaver-2: Implement total calculation
↓
Integration Test: Verify end-to-end flow
```

### Pattern 2: System Integration  

**Characteristics**: Connecting to external systems or internal services
**Observable Actions**: Data flows and error handling
**Coordination Pattern**: Spike-then-implement

**Example**: "Integrate with payment processor"
```json
{
  "pattern": "system_integration",
  "observableActions": [
    "User sees payment form with valid options",
    "User gets immediate feedback on payment failure",
    "User receives confirmation for successful payment"
  ],
  "orchestration": "spike_then_parallel_implement"
}
```

**Agent Coordination**:
```
Pathseeker: Identify integration requirements
↓
Sub-Agent Spikes: Research payment API, security requirements, error patterns
↓
Pathseeker Synthesis: Define implementation tasks
↓
Parallel Codeweaver: Payment form + API service + error handling
```

### Pattern 3: Data Model Evolution

**Characteristics**: Changes to data structures affecting multiple components
**Observable Actions**: User sees updated information consistently
**Coordination Pattern**: Foundation-first with migration

**Example**: "Add user preferences to profiles"
```json
{
  "pattern": "data_model_evolution", 
  "observableActions": [
    "User can set notification preferences",
    "User preferences persist across sessions",
    "User sees preferences reflected in all areas"
  ],
  "orchestration": "foundation_first_with_migration"
}
```

**Agent Coordination**:
```
Pathseeker: Map data model changes and affected components
↓
Codeweaver-1: Update data types and database schema
↓
Validation: Ensure data integrity
↓
Parallel Codeweaver: Update all affected components
↓
Siegemaster: Test data consistency across system
```

### Pattern 4: Performance Optimization

**Characteristics**: Improving system performance without changing user experience
**Observable Actions**: User notices faster, more responsive behavior
**Coordination Pattern**: Measure-optimize-verify

**Example**: "Speed up dashboard loading"
```json
{
  "pattern": "performance_optimization",
  "observableActions": [
    "Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds",
    "User sees loading indicators during data fetch",
    "User can interact with partial data while loading"
  ],
  "orchestration": "measure_optimize_verify"
}
```

**Agent Coordination**:
```
Pathseeker: Define performance targets and measurement
↓
Sub-Agent Analysis: Identify performance bottlenecks
↓
Parallel Codeweaver: Implement optimizations independently
↓
Siegemaster: Performance testing and verification
↓
Spiritmender: Fix any regressions introduced
```

### Pattern 5: Feature Exploration

**Characteristics**: Experimental features with uncertain requirements
**Observable Actions**: User can try new behavior and provide feedback
**Coordination Pattern**: Prototype-validate-iterate

**Example**: "Experiment with AI-powered recommendations"
```json
{
  "pattern": "feature_exploration",
  "observableActions": [
    "User sees personalized recommendations",
    "User can indicate if recommendations are helpful",
    "User recommendations improve over time"
  ],
  "orchestration": "prototype_validate_iterate"
}
```

**Agent Coordination**:
```
Pathseeker: Define minimal viable observable actions
↓
Codeweaver: Implement basic prototype
↓
User Feedback: Test with real users
↓
Pathseeker: Refine based on feedback
↓
Iterative Implementation: Improve based on learnings
```

## Escape Hatch Patterns by Quest Type

### User Journey Escape Patterns

**Common Escape**: User feedback reveals fundamental UX flaw
```json
{
  "escapeReason": "user_experience_assumption_invalid",
  "discovery": "Users don't want streamlined checkout, they want detailed review",
  "action": "restart_with_revised_user_journey"
}
```

### Integration Escape Patterns

**Common Escape**: External system behavior different than documented
```json
{
  "escapeReason": "external_system_api_mismatch", 
  "discovery": "Payment API returns different error codes than documented",
  "action": "add_spike_task_for_empirical_api_testing"
}
```

### Data Model Escape Patterns

**Common Escape**: Migration complexity exceeds task scope
```json
{
  "escapeReason": "data_migration_complexity",
  "discovery": "Existing data has inconsistent formats requiring cleanup",
  "action": "separate_data_cleanup_from_model_changes"
}
```

## Learning Pattern Evolution

### Pattern Recognition Development

**Early System**: Applies generic coordination regardless of quest type
**Learning System**: Recognizes patterns and applies appropriate coordination
**Mature System**: Predicts likely escape scenarios and preemptively adjusts

### Cross-Pattern Learning

**Insight Transfer**:
```json
{
  "learnedFromPattern": "system_integration",
  "insight": "Always spike external APIs before implementing",
  "applyToPattern": "data_model_evolution", 
  "application": "Always spike data migration scripts before schema changes"
}
```

### Project-Specific Pattern Customization

**Team Learning**:
```json
{
  "project": "e-commerce-platform",
  "customization": {
    "user_journey_patterns": "Always include mobile responsive behavior",
    "integration_patterns": "Always include payment security review",
    "performance_patterns": "Test with production data volume"
  }
}
```

## Coordination Anti-Patterns

### Sequential When Should Be Parallel

**Problem**: User journey improvements implemented one step at a time
**Solution**: Identify independent user actions and parallelize implementation

### Parallel When Should Be Sequential  

**Problem**: Data model changes implemented in parallel causing conflicts
**Solution**: Recognize foundation-dependent work and sequence appropriately

### Over-Spiking

**Problem**: Too much research before implementation, analysis paralysis
**Solution**: Implement minimal spike, learn through building

### Under-Spiking

**Problem**: Integration tasks fail due to external system surprises
**Solution**: Always spike external dependencies before major implementation

## Success Metrics by Pattern

### User Journey Patterns
- User task completion rate improvement
- User satisfaction feedback
- Reduced support tickets related to workflow

### Integration Patterns  
- Successful data exchange rate
- Error recovery effectiveness
- System uptime during integration

### Data Model Patterns
- Zero data loss during migration
- Performance maintained after changes
- All consuming systems work correctly

### Performance Patterns
- Measurable speed improvements
- No functionality regressions
- User-perceived performance improvement

### Exploration Patterns
- User engagement with new feature
- Quality of user feedback collected
- Learning velocity for product decisions

## Dynamic Pattern Recognition

### Pattern Detection During Dialogue

**Pathseeker learns to recognize patterns**:
```
User: "The checkout is too slow and confusing"
Pattern Indicators: Speed + UX = Performance + User Journey hybrid
Coordination: Measure current performance + Map user experience + Parallel optimization
```

### Pattern Switching Mid-Quest

**When patterns change**:
```json
{
  "originalPattern": "feature_exploration",
  "newPattern": "system_integration", 
  "trigger": "User feedback showed need for external service integration",
  "adjustment": "Add spike tasks for external API research"
}
```

The orchestration system becomes increasingly sophisticated at **pattern recognition** and **coordination strategy selection**, leading to more efficient quest completion and fewer agent escape scenarios over time.
