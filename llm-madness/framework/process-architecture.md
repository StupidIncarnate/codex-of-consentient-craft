# Process Architecture: User Request to Working Implementation

How the Questmaestro orchestration system transforms user requests into working code through dialogue, agent coordination, and empirical learning.

## Theoretical Foundation

**The Traditional Development Problem**: Converting user ideas into working software requires:
- Understanding ambiguous requirements
- Making architectural decisions
- Coordinating multiple implementation pieces
- Managing complexity without losing coherence
- Verifying everything works together

**LLM Limitations for This Process**:
- Context accumulation degrades performance over conversations
- Cannot make consistent architectural decisions across sessions
- No learning from previous mistakes
- Success theater when approaching context limits

**The Solution**: **Orchestrated agent pipeline** where each stage has:
- Fresh context and specialized responsibility
- Clear input/output contracts
- Escape mechanisms for complexity overload
- Empirical learning through controlled failure

## The Questmaestro Process Pipeline

### Stage 1: User Dialogue and Discovery (Pathseeker)

**Input**: Natural language user request (however expressed)
**Process**: Interactive dialogue until clarity achieved
**Output**: Observable atomic actions with clear boundaries

```
User: "I need better error handling"
↓
Pathseeker Dialogue:
- "What errors are users experiencing?"
- "What should happen when errors occur?"
- "What's the user experience during failures?"
↓
Observable Actions:
- "User sees helpful error message instead of crash"
- "User can retry failed action with one click"
- "User gets guided recovery steps for common errors"
```

**Key Insight**: Pathseeker never assumes understanding - keeps asking until observable behaviors are crystal clear.

### Stage 2: Task Decomposition (Pathseeker)

**Input**: Observable atomic actions
**Process**: Break each action into implementation tasks
**Output**: JSON task definitions with dependencies

```json
{
  "action": "user-sees-helpful-error-message",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "implement-error-message-component",
      "type": "implementation",
      "files": ["src/components/ErrorMessage.tsx"],
      "estimatedSize": "100-150 lines"
    },
    {
      "id": "implement-error-classification-service", 
      "type": "implementation",
      "files": ["src/services/error-classifier.ts"],
      "estimatedSize": "75-100 lines"
    },
    {
      "id": "integrate-error-boundary-wrapper",
      "type": "implementation", 
      "dependencies": ["implement-error-message-component"],
      "files": ["src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx"],
      "estimatedSize": "50-75 lines"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Stage 3: Parallel Implementation (Multiple Codeweaver Agents)

**Input**: Individual task definitions with fresh context
**Process**: Each agent implements assigned files exclusively
**Output**: Working code + tests or escape hatch report

```
Codeweaver-1: implement-error-message-component
Codeweaver-2: implement-error-classification-service
Codeweaver-3: (waits for dependencies)
```

**Fresh Context Per Agent**: Each Codeweaver gets:
- Task definition
- Relevant project patterns
- Interface contracts
- Zero conversation history

### Stage 4: Quality Review (Lawbringer)

**Input**: All parallel implementation outputs
**Process**: Review for consistency, quality, integration
**Output**: Refinements and standardization

```json
{
  "review": "implementations_consistent",
  "changes": [
    "Standardized error message format across components",
    "Added missing TypeScript types for error classifier",
    "Unified logging patterns"
  ],
  "status": "complete"
}
```

### Stage 5: Integration Testing (Siegemaster)

**Input**: All implemented code
**Process**: Create tests that verify observable actions work end-to-end
**Output**: Integration test suite

```javascript
// Integration test verifying observable action
it('user sees helpful error message when API fails', async () => {
  // Simulate API failure
  mockApiCall.mockRejectedValue(new NetworkError('Connection timeout'));
  
  // User action that triggers error
  await userEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('SUBMIT_BUTTON'));
  
  // Verify observable outcome
  expect(screen.getByTestId('ERROR_MESSAGE')).toHaveTextContent(
    /^Connection problem. Check your internet and try again.$/
  );
  expect(screen.getByTestId('RETRY_BUTTON')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Stage 6: Validation and Healing (Spiritmender)

**Input**: Complete implementation + test results
**Process**: Run ward:all, fix any failures
**Output**: Fully working, validated code

## Agent Escape Hatch Integration

### When Agents Escape

**Any agent can exit with failure report**:
```json
{
  "agent": "codeweaver",
  "task": "implement-error-classification-service", 
  "status": "blocked",
  "reason": "task_too_complex",
  "analysis": "Error classification requires ML model integration, API rate limiting, fallback strategies - exceeds single task scope",
  "recommendation": "split_into_basic_classification_plus_advanced_features"
}
```

### Re-decomposition Cycle

**Fresh Pathseeker spawned with**:
- Original observable action
- Failed task context
- Specific complexity discovered
- Recommendation from failed agent

**New decomposition**:
```json
{
  "learningFromFailure": {
    "originalTask": "implement-error-classification-service",
    "newTasks": [
      "implement-basic-error-categorization",
      "implement-user-friendly-message-mapping", 
      "create-error-context-collector"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Sub-Agent Coordination Patterns

### When Parent Agents Delegate

**Pathseeker Assessment**:
```
Quest Scope: "Improve application error handling"
Complexity: High (multiple systems, existing integrations, user experience considerations)
Decision: Spawn sub-agents for parallel analysis
```

**Sub-Agent Delegation**:
```json
{
  "subAgents": [
    {
      "task": "analyze-existing-error-patterns",
      "scope": "Identify current error handling approaches"
    },
    {
      "task": "research-user-experience-requirements", 
      "scope": "Understand what users need from error messages"
    },
    {
      "task": "map-integration-requirements",
      "scope": "Identify systems that need error handling integration"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Parent Agent Synthesis**: Combines sub-agent findings into cohesive task decomposition.

## Iterative Refinement Through Learning

### System Learning Integration

**Pattern Recognition**:
```json
{
  "learnedPattern": "error_handling_tasks",
  "observation": "Tasks involving 'error handling' consistently need UI + service + integration components",
  "recommendation": "Pre-split error handling features into these three categories"
}
```

**Decomposition Evolution**:
- **Early System**: Generic task breakdown
- **Learning System**: Pattern-based decomposition  
- **Mature System**: Project-specific optimization

### Cross-Quest Knowledge Application

**Knowledge Transfer**:
```json
{
  "previousQuest": "user-authentication-system",
  "learnedBoundaries": {
    "frontend_components": "100-150 lines optimal",
    "service_layers": "split_when_multiple_integrations",
    "validation_logic": "separate_from_business_logic"
  },
  "applyToCurrentQuest": "error-handling-system"
}
```

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Continuous Validation Points

**After Each Stage**:
1. **Pathseeker Output**: Observable actions validated with user
2. **Task Decomposition**: Size estimates checked against learned patterns  
3. **Implementation**: Each agent output validated immediately
4. **Integration**: End-to-end behavior verified
5. **Final Validation**: Complete system verification

### Failure Recovery Coordination

**Stage-Level Recovery**:
- **Single Agent Failure**: Re-spawn with refined task
- **Multiple Agent Conflicts**: Architecture review cycle
- **Integration Failures**: Back to decomposition with conflict analysis
- **System-Level Issues**: Human escalation

## Success Criteria and Completion

### Observable Action Completion

**Each action complete when**:
- User can demonstrate the behavior working
- Integration tests pass for the specific action
- Edge cases and error scenarios handled
- Code meets quality standards

### Quest Completion

**Full quest complete when**:
- All observable actions demonstrably working
- Integration tests pass end-to-end
- Ward:all validation passes
- User accepts the implementation

## The Meta-Process: Learning and Adaptation

### Process Improvement Through Usage

**The system learns**:
- Which dialogue patterns lead to clearer observable actions
- Which task sizes consistently succeed vs. fail
- Which agent coordination patterns avoid conflicts
- Which quality gates catch the most issues

### Adaptation Mechanisms

**Dynamic Process Adjustment**:
- More sub-agent usage for complex domains
- Adjusted task size estimates based on project patterns
- Modified dialogue scripts based on user communication styles
- Refined escape hatch triggers based on failure analysis

## The Reality: Embracing Iteration

### Not a Waterfall Process

The pipeline **appears sequential** but is actually **iterative with escape hatches**:
- Any stage can trigger re-decomposition
- Learning happens continuously
- Success emerges through controlled experimentation
- Perfect planning is neither expected nor required

### Key Insight

**The process succeeds not by preventing all failures but by making failures productive** - each escape hatch provides specific learning that improves subsequent decomposition attempts.

The architecture transforms **unpredictable LLM behavior** into **reliable software delivery** through orchestration, specialization, and empirical learning rather than trying to make LLMs more predictable.
