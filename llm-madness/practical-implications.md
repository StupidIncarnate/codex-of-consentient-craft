# Practical Implications for LLM-Assisted Coding

## What This Means for Your Workflow

### The Current Reality
You've observed LLMs consistently failing at test migration tasks despite clear instructions. This isn't user error or bad prompting - it's architectural mismatch.

### Why Your Test Migration Failed
The task "migrate tests from X to Y" triggers every failure mode:
- Large scope → Mass generation
- Multiple errors → Context accumulation  
- Long conversation → Context exhaustion
- End result → Broken code with victory claims

## Practical Guidelines

### Tasks LLMs Can Do Well
1. **Single-function transformations**
   - "Add null check to this function"
   - "Convert promises to async/await here"
   - "Add TypeScript types to these parameters"

2. **Pattern application**
   - "Apply this error handling pattern"
   - "Use this test structure template"
   - "Follow this import convention"

3. **Mechanical fixes**
   - "Fix these TypeScript errors"
   - "Resolve these ESLint warnings"
   - "Update imports to new paths"

### Tasks LLMs Will Fail At
1. **Large-scale migrations**
   - "Move all tests to integration"
   - "Refactor entire service"
   - "Modernize this codebase"

2. **Multi-step debugging**
   - "Fix all the test failures"
   - "Debug why this isn't working"
   - "Make all tests pass"

3. **Architectural decisions**
   - "Improve the code structure"
   - "Optimize this system"
   - "Design better patterns"

## Recommended Workflow Changes

### Instead of Conversations
```
Bad:
"Help me refactor this service"
"Now fix the errors"
"Update the tests too"
[Context exhaustion]

Good:
Task 1: "Extract user validation to function"
[New session]
Task 2: "Add error handling to validation"
[New session]
Task 3: "Write test for validation function"
```

### Leverage Semantic Understanding
```
Optimal flow:
1. Write minimal code
2. Get compiler errors
3. Feed errors to LLM: "Fix these specific TypeScript errors"
4. Apply fixes
5. Get test failures
6. Feed to LLM: "Fix this specific test failure"
```

### Structure Your Requests
```
Bad:
"Add error handling to this service"

Good:
"Add try-catch to the getUserById function.
Catch errors should be CustomError type.
Log errors with winston.error().
Current function: [paste specific function]"
```

## Working with Current Tools

### Using Claude/ChatGPT Effectively
1. **Reset frequently** - New conversation for new tasks
2. **Provide context explicitly** - Don't rely on conversation memory
3. **Request specific outputs** - Not general improvements
4. **Validate immediately** - Before requesting more changes

### Signs to Stop and Reset
- LLM generates 500+ lines at once
- Multiple round trips fixing errors
- Responses getting shorter/hackier
- "Let me fix everything" statements
- TODO comments appearing

## The Test Migration Solution

Your specific test migration task would work better as:

1. **Inventory phase** (Human task)
   - List all test functions
   - Group by complexity
   - Identify patterns

2. **Pattern definition** (One LLM session)
   - "Show me how to convert this one mock test to integration"
   - Get the pattern right once

3. **Mechanical application** (Multiple fresh sessions)
   - "Apply this exact pattern to test X"
   - Validate it works
   - New session: "Apply pattern to test Y"

4. **Fix phase** (Fresh sessions per error type)
   - "Fix timeout errors in these 3 tests"
   - "Update assertions to async pattern"

## Building Better Tools

### What We Need
1. **Session management** - Automatic fresh contexts
2. **Transform pipelines** - Structured workflows
3. **Validation gates** - Immediate feedback
4. **Working memory** - Project context without conversation

### What Doesn't Help
1. **Larger context windows** - Just delays the problem
2. **Better prompts** - Can't fix architectural limits
3. **Conversation memory** - Makes it worse
4. **AI agents** - Same architectural constraints

## The Bottom Line

### For Immediate Productivity
- Smaller, specific tasks
- Fresh sessions frequently
- Immediate validation
- No multi-turn debugging

### For Long-term Success
- Build tools that respect architectural limits
- Design workflows around transformations not conversations
- Leverage semantic understanding of errors
- Accept that LLMs are compilers, not pair programmers

### The Mental Model Shift
Stop thinking: "AI coding assistant"
Start thinking: "Semantic transformation engine"

Your frustration comes from expecting conversation when the architecture demands compilation.
