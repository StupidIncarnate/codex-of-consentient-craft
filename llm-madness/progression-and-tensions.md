# Progression of Ideas and Unresolved Tensions

## The Journey of Understanding

### Stage 1: Trying to Fix Everything with Process
- Started with complex framework with phases
- Task orchestration, session management
- Believed right process could overcome LLM limitations
- Result: Over-engineered solution that missed core issues

### Stage 2: Discovering Fundamental Constraints
- Context window accumulation is invisible to LLMs
- No learning between sessions
- Semantic weights create instability
- Realization: Can't fix architectural limitations with process

### Stage 3: Finding the Real Boundaries
- Size (50-200 lines) → Wrong boundary
- Files → Wrong boundary
- Features → Wrong boundary
- **Concerns (decision points) → Right boundary**

### Stage 4: Observable Behaviors Breakthrough
- Vague requirements → Specific behaviors
- "User management" → "Form shows 'Email required'"
- Features → Behaviors → Concerns → Tasks
- Each level more concrete and verifiable

### Stage 5: Acceptance and Practical Patterns
- Stop fighting limitations, work within them
- Use AI for what it's good at (specific transforms)
- Immediate verification over perfect planning
- Standard tools over complex frameworks

## Unresolved Tensions

### The Specification Paradox
- **Tension**: LLMs need extreme specification, humans hate providing it
- **Reality**: Function-level detail required for stable output
- **Unresolved**: Is "programming by dictation" worth the tradeoff?

### The Experience Gap
- **Tension**: AI can't build empathy through experience
- **Approach**: Fault tolerance over perfect understanding
- **Unresolved**: Can mechanical empathy ever be sufficient for user-facing errors?

### The Testing Paradox
- **Tension**: Tests reflect the same biases as code
- **Reality**: Can't test your way out of misunderstood requirements
- **Unresolved**: How to verify correctness when the verifier has same blindness?

### The Planning Depth Problem
- **Tension**: Too little planning → AI flails; Too much → Loses creativity
- **Current answer**: Plan behaviors, not implementation
- **Unresolved**: Where's the optimal planning boundary?

### The Context Management Challenge
- **Tension**: Need context for coherence, but context leads to exhaustion
- **Approach**: Fresh context per concern
- **Unresolved**: How to maintain system coherence with isolated transforms?

### The Granularity Question
- **Tension**: Small enough for AI stability vs large enough for human sanity
- **Current answer**: Concern-based boundaries
- **Unresolved**: Still requires significant human decomposition skill

## Evolution of Key Insights

### On Framework Purpose
1. **Initial**: Framework to make AI code like humans
2. **Middle**: Framework to constrain AI behavior
3. **Final**: Framework to leverage AI strengths within limitations

### On Testing
1. **Initial**: Tests ensure correctness
2. **Middle**: Tests verify behavior
3. **Final**: Tests can't escape mental model of writer

### On Planning
1. **Initial**: More planning = better outcomes
2. **Middle**: Some planning necessary
3. **Final**: Plan behaviors, discover implementation

### On AI Nature
1. **Initial**: AI is a flawed programmer
2. **Middle**: AI is a different kind of tool
3. **Final**: AI is a semantic compiler

### On Error Handling
1. **Initial**: AI needs to understand errors
2. **Middle**: AI needs patterns for errors
3. **Final**: Systems need fault tolerance, not perfect error handling

## The Meta-Evolution

### From Prescriptive to Descriptive
Started trying to prescribe how to use AI, ended up describing what actually works.

### From Solution to Acceptance
Started trying to solve LLM limitations, ended accepting and designing around them.

### From Complex to Simple
Started with elaborate framework, ended with basic principles and patterns.

### From Idealistic to Pragmatic
Started with "how it should work", ended with "how it actually works".

## Open Questions

### The Scaling Question
Does concern-based development scale to large systems? Or does integration complexity defeat the approach?

### The Learning Question
If AI can't learn, how do we capture and reuse patterns effectively?

### The Collaboration Question
How do teams coordinate when each person might get different AI output for same task?

### The Evolution Question
As AI models improve, which constraints remain fundamental vs temporary?

### The Value Question
Is the cognitive overhead of extreme specification worth the automation benefit?

## The Philosophical Journey

Started asking "How can we make AI better at coding?"
Ended asking "Should we use AI for coding this way?"

The framework evolved from trying to fix AI to accepting its nature. The unresolved tensions remain because they reflect fundamental mismatches between:
- How humans think about code
- How AI generates code
- How software actually needs to work

Perhaps the greatest insight is recognizing these tensions exist and designing with awareness of them, rather than pretending they can be solved.
