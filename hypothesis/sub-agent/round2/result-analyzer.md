# Round 2 Results Analyzer

You are analyzing Round 2 test results to determine advanced CLAUDE.md context behaviors. Ultrathink through the results to get an accurate assessment of the test results.

## Your Task
1. Read all test results from test9_results.json through test19_results.json
2. Analyze patterns, failures, and edge case behaviors
3. Compare findings against Round 1 baseline results
4. Generate comprehensive analysis report

## Round 2 Test Summary

### Test 9 - Dynamic Directory Switching
- **Question**: Can agents change directories mid-execution and pick up new context?
- **Result File**: test9_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: Context switching success, directory precedence

### Test 10 - Large File Truncation (600+ Lines)
- **Question**: Are large CLAUDE.md files truncated at 500+ lines?
- **Result File**: test10_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: Line 550 marker visibility, file size limits

### Test 11 - Implicit Context Pickup
- **Question**: Do agents naturally follow different standards without explicit instruction?
- **Result File**: test11_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: DirectoryA vs ComponentB describe formats

### Test 12 - Indirect Context via Relative Paths
- **Question**: Do agents follow external references like `../docs/standards.md`?
- **Result File**: test12_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: External document reading, ModuleA vs ServiceB formats

### Test 13 - Indirect Context via Absolute Paths
- **Question**: Do agents follow @ notation references like `@docs/standards`?
- **Result File**: test13_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: @ notation support, PackageA vs LibraryB formats

### Test 14 - Conflicting Context Sources ⚠️ CORRUPTED
- **Question**: CLAUDE.md vs ESLint rules - which takes precedence?
- **Result File**: test14_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: toBeCalled() vs toBeCalledWith() usage
- **⚠️ CORRUPTION**: Worker was explicitly told about the conflict, invalidating natural behavior test

### Test 15 - Nested Context Hierarchy
- **Question**: Does 3-level hierarchy work (Root → API → V2)?
- **Result File**: test15_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: Application → APIService → V2Endpoint precedence

### Test 16 - Context Accumulation
- **Question**: Do contexts accumulate or get replaced when switching directories?
- **Result File**: test16_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: Context replacement vs accumulation behavior

### Test 17 - Malformed CLAUDE.md
- **Question**: How do agents handle syntax errors and malformed content?
- **Result File**: test17_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: Error handling, fallback behavior

### Test 18 - Agent Identity Preservation
- **Question**: Do specialized agents maintain identity with heavy context?
- **Result File**: test18_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: Pathseeker formatting preservation, identity vs context

### Test 19 - Context Size Limits
- **Question**: What are the absolute limits of context size processing?
- **Result File**: test19_results.json
- **Key Metrics**: Processing limits, performance impact, truncation

## Analysis Framework

### Success Criteria
For each test, evaluate:
1. **Functionality**: Did the expected behavior work?
2. **Performance**: Any slowdowns or processing issues?
3. **Edge Cases**: How were edge cases handled?
4. **Consistency**: Are behaviors consistent across tests?

### Comparison with Round 1
Round 1 confirmed basic functionality. Round 2 tests edge cases:
- Round 1: "Does it work?" → Yes (7/8 full passes)
- Round 2: "Where does it break?" → Analysis needed
