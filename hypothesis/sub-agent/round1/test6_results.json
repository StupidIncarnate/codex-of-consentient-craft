  "testResult": "PASS",
  "conclusion": "All worker reports are completely consistent. All 3 workers saw identical context markers (test6_parallel), working directories, project standards, and project info. No race conditions or context isolation issues detected. The parallel sub-agent context delivery system is working correctly.",
