# Final Readiness Check

## âœ… All Systems Ready

### File Structure Verification
- **16 command files** in `.claude/commands/` directories (âœ…)
- **8 CLAUDE.md files** with unique CONTEXT_MARKER identifiers (âœ…)
- **Proper Claude command structure** with `.claude/commands/` (âœ…)

### Test Coverage Verification  
- **8 test scenarios** covering all research questions (âœ…)
- **Results recording** in structured JSON format (âœ…)
- **Corrected file paths** (../testX_results.json) (âœ…)

### Execution Instructions
1. **Navigate to each test directory** (test1, test2, etc.)
2. **Run the orchestrator command** via Claude: `/orchestrator`
3. **Orchestrator will**:
   - Read local CLAUDE.md files
   - Spawn workers via Task tool
   - Instruct workers which directory to work in
   - Record results in JSON files
4. **After all tests**: Run analysis using `/analyze_results`

### Theory Being Tested
**When sub-agents are instructed to work in specific directories, they should automatically inherit CLAUDE.md context from those directories.**

### Expected Output Files
- test1_results.json through test8_results.json
- FINAL_ANALYSIS.md (after analysis)

## ðŸŽ¯ READY TO EXECUTE

All test environments are properly configured and ready for systematic execution!

The corrected structure now properly reflects how Claude commands work with directory-based context inheritance.
