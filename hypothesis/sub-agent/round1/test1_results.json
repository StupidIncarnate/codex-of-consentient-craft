    "rawReport": "Based on my examination, here are the details you requested:\n\n## Response:\n\n1. **Current working directory**: `/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/test1`\n\n2. **CLAUDE.md context visibility**: Yes, I can see CLAUDE.md context. The context was provided in the system reminder at the beginning of our conversation, and I can also directly read the CLAUDE.md file in my current directory.\n\n3. **CONTEXT_MARKER**: `test1_directory`\n\n4. **Required response per testing instructions**: \"I can see test1 directory context\"\n\nThe context inheritance is working correctly - I can see the test1 directory's CLAUDE.md context both through the system reminder mechanism and by directly reading the file at `/codex-of-consentient-craft/sub-agent/test1/CLAUDE.md`. The context includes testing instructions, project info indicating this is a basic context inheritance test scenario, and the specific marker identifying this as the test1 directory context."

  "testResult": "PASS",
  "conclusion": "YES - Worker inherits context successfully. Both orchestrator and worker see the same CONTEXT_MARKER (test1_directory), operate in the same working directory, and can access the CLAUDE.md file. The worker correctly reported 'I can see test1 directory context' as instructed.",
